## 🚀 Why I’m the Best Thing Since Sliced Bread

- **Loan Origination Wizardry**  
  Slashed customer development time by **90%** and saved **75%** in developer resources with a process-driven loan origination solution using Java, JavaScript, and Salesforce Omnistudio.  
  *Yes, I run on coffee and unstoppable ambition.*

- **GPT-Powered Brilliance**  
  Engineered a GPT-driven loan intake system integrated with Salesforce Einstein AI—pushing applicant completion rates up by **70%** and dazzling the crowd at Dreamforce.  
  *AI is cool; GPT is cooler.*

- **Performance Overload**  
  Optimized APIs and queries, reducing latency by **95%** (from 2000ms to 100ms). Also discovered the meaning of life somewhere in those logs.  

- **All About That Data**  
  Built an asynchronous, scalable cascade-deletion system to keep data squeaky-clean and orchestrated migrations to MongoDB.  
  *I thrive in big-data chaos. My commits are your safety net.*

- **DevOps Ninja Moves**  
  Turbocharged deployment pipelines, cutting release times from **1 hour down to 10 minutes** with Drone.io, Kubernetes, and canary rollouts.  
  *My motto? “Better, Faster, Ship It Yesterday.”*

- **Cloud-Native Hustle**  
  Led the creation of a cloud-native bankruptcy management platform that processes **1000+ cases, 50k claims, and 22k creditors**. Because who doesn’t love high-stakes data storms?
